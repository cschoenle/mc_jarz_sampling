# About
This is the repository with code connected to the following paper:

C.Schönle, M. Gabrié, T. Lelièvre, G. Stoltz. "Sampling metastable systems using collective variables and 
Jarzynski-Crooks paths", arXiv:2405.18160 (2024)

We provide the implementation of the five valid sampling algorithms described in the manuscript in `samplers.py` 
as well as three biased versions in `samplers_biased.py`.

A basic usage example for the Gaussian tunnel example is given in the notebook `gaussian_tunnel.ipynb`.
